There are n students seating at individual desks in a classroom numbered from 0 to n-1 with n-1 friendships among them. All students want to communicate with the student at desk 0, but they cannot get up to walk around in the classroom. The only way they can get to student 0 is through their mutual friend. You are given an array of integers arr of (2*(n-1)) elements, where arr[i+1] is a friend of arr[i  for all i(i%2=0). However, the reverse isn't true. You want to create a program that returns the minimum number of friendships (MinNewFriendships) that need to be established so all students in the class can communicate with student at desk number 0, no matter where they are seated. Keep in mind that you can make student B a friend of student A only if student A is already a friend of student B. A friend of yours has witten the initial code for this program but it doesn't work. Task is to investigate and fix the bug. Take the following into account: 2 <= n <= 30 and also 0 <= arr[i] <= n-1 (0 <= i < n). Fix and complete the next code: 

```go
package testtaker

import (
	"fmt"
)

func MinNewFriendships(n int, arr []int) int {
    // Initialize adjacency matrix and graph
    weight := make([][]int, n)
    for i := range weight {
        weight[i] = make([]int, n)
    }
    graph := make(map[int][]int, n)

    // Build the graph and weight matrix from the input array
    for i := 0; i < 2*n; i += 2 {
        u := arr[i]   // Node u
        v := arr[i+1] // Node v
        graph[u] = append(graph[u], v)
        graph[v] = append(graph[v], u)
        weight[u][v] = 1 // Set weight for u -> v
    }

    // Start DFS traversal from node 0 with no parent (-1)
    return dfs(0, -1, graph, weight)
}

func dfs(node, parent int, graph map[int][]int, weight [][]int) int {
    ans := 0
    for _, neighbor := range graph[node] {
        if neighbor == parent {
            continue
        }
        // Accumulate weight from child nodes
        ans += weight[node][neighbor] + dfs(neighbor, node, graph, weight)
    }
    return ans
}

func main() {
    n := 3
    arr := []int{0, 1, 1, 2}
    fmt.Println(MinNewFriendships(n, arr)) // Expected output: 2
}

package testtaker

import (
	"fmt"
)

// MinNewFriendships finds the minimum number of new friendships required
func MinNewFriendships(n int, arr []int) int {
	// Step 1: Initialize the graph as an adjacency list
	graph := make(map[int][]int)
	reverseGraph := make(map[int][]int)

	// Step 2: Build the graph from the input array
	for i := 0; i < len(arr); i += 2 {
		u := arr[i]   // Node u
		v := arr[i+1] // Node v
		graph[u] = append(graph[u], v)
		reverseGraph[v] = append(reverseGraph[v], u)
	}

	// Step 3: Use DFS/BFS from node 0 to find all nodes that can reach node 0
	visited := make([]bool, n)

	// BFS function to visit nodes reachable from 0 in the reverse graph
	var bfs func(start int)
	bfs = func(start int) {
		queue := []int{start}
		visited[start] = true

		for len(queue) > 0 {
			current := queue[0]
			queue = queue[1:]

			// Visit all the neighbors in the reverse graph
			for _, neighbor := range reverseGraph[current] {
				if !visited[neighbor] {
					visited[neighbor] = true
					queue = append(queue, neighbor)
				}
			}
		}
	}

	// Start BFS from node 0
	bfs(0)

	// Step 4: Count the number of disconnected components
	// Any student that is not visited is in a separate component.
	additionalEdges := 0
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		if !visited[i] {
			additionalEdges++
			// Once we add a new friendship, mark all reachable students from that student
			bfs(i)
		}
	}

	return additionalEdges
}

func main() {
	// Test cases
	fmt.Println(MinNewFriendships(6, []int{0, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 0, 4, 5})) // Output: 3
	fmt.Println(MinNewFriendships(5, []int{0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 0, 4, 3}))       // Output: 1
	fmt.Println(MinNewFriendships(2, []int{1, 0}))                         // Output: 0
	fmt.Println(MinNewFriendships(5, []int{0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4}))       // Output: 4
}

Comprehensive student management system as a service: Users: faculty, staff and students parents. Requirements: track absences, tardies and excuses (entered by all users), manage from 1000 to 1 million students, Generate reports on student activities, be accessible from website, track students grades and assignments (completed and due), student/parent-teacher forums, runs a SaaS system from a Hosting Server. Additional context: company plans to undertake an aggressive national sales campaign, system planned to sold for different education levels (primary, high school, universities), current competitor damaged by data breach, new CIO.  DO: Present primary software quality attributes pivotal for developing this product and recommend a software architecture model, database model, technologies and interprocess communication and tools as necessary. Don't use 3rd party services from companies that might produce vendor lock-in.

To build a **Comprehensive Student Management System (SMS) as a Service** with the described features, it's crucial to focus on software quality attributes, architecture, and technology stack to ensure scalability, security, and flexibility. Here's a detailed breakdown of the key areas:

### 1. **Primary Software Quality Attributes:**

#### a) **Scalability**
   - **Vertical Scaling**: The system must handle a varying number of students, from 1,000 to 1 million. It should scale both horizontally (adding more servers) and vertically (increasing server capacity).
   - **Database Scalability**: The system must efficiently handle large amounts of student data (absences, tardies, grades, etc.). This requires both horizontal and vertical scalability at the database level.

#### b) **Availability & Reliability**
   - The system should ensure minimal downtime and data loss, crucial for schools where daily operations rely on it.
   - Use **replication** and **failover** mechanisms to ensure high availability.

#### c) **Security**
   - **Data Protection**: Ensure secure access to student data, especially with sensitive information like grades and personal details.
   - **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for faculty, staff, students, and parents to ensure the correct permissions.
   - **Data Encryption**: Use encryption (both at rest and in transit) to protect data from unauthorized access, especially given the data breach incident involving competitors.
   - **Audit Trails**: Track all interactions with the system for compliance, including changes to grades, attendance, and excuses.

#### d) **Performance**
   - Ensure that the system responds quickly, even with large amounts of concurrent users (students, teachers, parents).
   - Efficient data access, minimizing response time for user queries.

#### e) **Usability**
   - Easy-to-use interface for each user type (students, parents, faculty, staff).
   - Mobile-responsive and web-friendly to accommodate the varying tech literacy of students and parents.

#### f) **Maintainability**
   - **Modular Design**: The system should allow easy maintenance and updates without affecting the entire application.
   - **Testability**: Support for automated testing and continuous integration to ensure that new features don't break existing ones.

---

### 2. **Software Architecture Model:**

#### **Microservices Architecture**
   - **Reasoning**: A microservices architecture would be ideal, as it allows the system to be highly modular and scalable. Each functional area (e.g., student management, grades, attendance, etc.) can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
     - **Benefits**:
       - Flexibility to scale individual modules based on usage (e.g., more resources for grades, less for attendance).
       - Easy to integrate new features without impacting the whole system.
       - Decouples different aspects of the application (e.g., grades, forums, attendance tracking) for better fault tolerance and manageability.

#### **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - **Reasoning**: An event-driven approach ensures that changes (like grade updates or attendance marks) are immediately reflected across the system, making it suitable for the SaaS model where multiple users may interact simultaneously.

---

### 3. **Database Model:**

#### **Relational Database (SQL)**
   - **Reasoning**: Given the transactional nature of the system (attendance, grades, student activities), a relational database is recommended for data integrity and consistency.
   - **Choice**: **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**. Both are open-source, highly reliable, and offer horizontal scalability.
     - **PostgreSQL** is preferred for its support for complex queries and robustness in handling large datasets.
   - **Schema Design**:
     - **Students Table**: Contains student profiles, grades, and attendance.
     - **Faculty and Staff Tables**: Information about faculty and staff responsible for grades, activities, and assignments.
     - **Grades Table**: Tracks completed and pending assignments, with references to students and instructors.
     - **Attendance Table**: Records attendance, tardiness, and excuses for each student.
     - **Forums Table**: Keeps track of student-parent-teacher interactions.

#### **NoSQL for Scalability** (Optional for certain modules like forums)
   - For the forums and activity logs, **MongoDB** or **Cassandra** can be used. These systems scale horizontally and are ideal for handling large-scale, unstructured data like forum posts, messages, and interactions.

---

### 4. **Technologies & Tools:**

#### **Backend**
   - **Programming Language**: **Go** or **Java** (Spring Boot). Go is known for high performance and concurrency, making it suitable for microservices. Spring Boot is well-suited for enterprise-level applications with heavy integration needs.
   - **API Gateway**: **Kong** or **Traefik** for API management, rate-limiting, and monitoring.
   - **Service Discovery**: **Consul** or **Eureka** for dynamic discovery of microservices.
   - **Authentication**: **OAuth2** with **JWT** for secure, token-based user authentication.

#### **Frontend**
   - **React.js** or **Vue.js** for building responsive, user-friendly interfaces.
   - **Next.js** or **Nuxt.js** for server-side rendering (SSR) and SEO, especially important for student-related content like grades or reports that need to be visible to parents and students.

#### **Hosting / Infrastructure**
   - **Kubernetes (K8s)** for container orchestration and auto-scaling.
   - **Docker** for containerization of services, ensuring consistency across environments.
   - **Minikube** for local development/testing with Kubernetes.
   - **CI/CD Pipeline**: **Jenkins**, **GitLab CI**, or **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and delivery.
   - **Caching**: **Redis** for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., student grades, attendance) to reduce database load.

#### **Inter-process Communication**
   - **gRPC** for fast communication between microservices.
   - **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** for event-driven messaging, especially useful in cases like notifications or status updates (e.g., grade changes, attendance updates).

#### **Monitoring & Logging**
   - **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring system performance and health.
   - **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** for centralized logging and analysis.

### 5. **Deployment and Hosting**
   - **Cloud-Native Solution**: Host on private cloud infrastructure to avoid vendor lock-in, such as **OpenStack** or self-hosted solutions like **VMware**.
   - **Database Replication**: Set up replication across multiple regions to ensure high availability.
   - **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Implement robust backup strategies, ensuring that data can be restored in case of failure.

### 6. **Customer Success Factors**
   - **Multi-tenancy**: Design the system so each educational institution can customize their instance, maintaining privacy and scalability.
   - **User Experience**: Given that many users will have varying technical expertise, focus on intuitive interfaces, onboarding, and support.

### 7. **Summary Recommendations**:
   - **Architecture**: Microservices + Event-Driven Architecture.
   - **Database**: PostgreSQL for core transactional data, MongoDB for forums.
   - **Frontend**: React.js or Vue.js with server-side rendering.
   - **Backend**: Go or Java with Spring Boot, using gRPC for service communication.
   - **Hosting**: Kubernetes, Docker, CI/CD pipelines for smooth deployment and scaling.
   - **Security**: OAuth2 with JWT, role-based access control, encryption at rest and in transit.
