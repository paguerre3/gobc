# Modular Monoliths

**Modular Monoliths** in Go is a modern approach that combines the benefits of a monolithic architecture with modular design principles, allowing for clear boundaries between components without fully splitting into microservices. This pattern is gaining traction for applications that need maintainability, scalability, and flexibility without the overhead of microservices.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Modularization**: Structuring your Go application into self-contained modules/packages, each with its own domain logic, models, and services.
2. **Decoupling**: Using Go interfaces to enforce loose coupling between modules.
3. **Bounded Contexts**: Applying Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles within each module.
4. **Internal Packages**: Leveraging Go's `internal` package to prevent other modules from accessing non-public APIs, ensuring encapsulation.

### Example Structure:
```
/project-root
├── cmd/
│   └── main.go
├── internal/
│   ├── user/
│   │   ├── service.go
│   │   ├── repository.go
│   │   ├── handler.go
│   └── order/
│       ├── service.go
│       ├── repository.go
│       ├── handler.go
├── pkg/
│   └── logger/
│       └── logger.go
└── go.mod
```

### Best Practices:
- **Use Dependency Injection**: Helps in testing and maintaining loose coupling.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Enforce boundaries between your modules.
- **Interfaces for Abstractions**: Use interfaces to define module contracts.
- **Gradual Microservices Transition**: A modular monolith can be split into microservices as needed over time.

This approach allows Go developers to start with a simpler monolithic architecture while maintaining flexibility for future growth. It balances development speed and architectural integrity, making it suitable for scalable, maintainable Go applications.
